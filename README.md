# 📚 Data Structures – Sorting Algorithms in C++

---

## 📋 Overview

This repository provides clean, well-documented C++ implementations of fundamental **sorting algorithms** used in computer science and software engineering.  
It's a valuable resource for students, educators, and learning algorithm design and analysis.

## 🚀 Included Sorting Algorithms

1. 🔁 **Bubble Sort**  
   - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. 🔂 **Selection Sort**  
   - Selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the correct position.
3. 🔁 **Insertion Sort**  
   - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
4. 📉 **Shell Sort**  
   - Generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items far apart.
5. 🔀 **Merge Sort**  
   - Divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits and merges arrays.
6. ⚡ **Quick Sort**  
   - Uses a pivot to partition the array, then sorts recursively.
7. 📊 **Count Sort (Counting Sort)**  
   - Non-comparison-based sorting, efficient when the range of values is known.
